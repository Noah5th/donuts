 <h1>History of Donuts</h1>
 <center><p>In 1920, Russian-born immigrant Adolph Levitt created the first automated doughnut machine. The futuristic automated donut-making process was featured at the 1934 Worldâ€™s Fair in Chicago. From this day on the donuts were a huge hit as a breakfast treat. With this machine donuts were easier to make and sell. Once they were easier to make and sell they were mass produced. Once mass produced they bacame the iconic thing they are today.</p></center>
